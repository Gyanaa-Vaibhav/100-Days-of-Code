        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and investor best known
        for co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder
        of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business
        partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before
        withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen
        Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.
        Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly
        successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was
        mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in
        1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh
        introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer
        to feature vector graphics.</p>

            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Warren Edward Buffett is an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist who currently serves as the
                co-founder, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. As a result of his immense investment success, Buffett
                is one of the best-known investors in the world. As of March 2024, he had a net-worth of $134 billion,
                making him the seventh-richest person in the world.
                Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. The son of US congressman and businessman Howard Buffett, he developed
                an interest
                in business and investing during his youth. He entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania
                in 1947
                before graduating from the University of Nebraska at 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business
                School, where he
                molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He
                attended New
                York Institute of Finance to focus on his economics background and soon pursued a business career. He later
                began
                various business ventures and investment partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett
                Partnership Ltd. in
                1956 and his investment firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway, assuming
                its name to
                create a diversified holding company. Buffett emerged as the company's chairman and majority shareholder in
                1970. In
                1978, fellow investor and long-time business associate Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman.</p>
